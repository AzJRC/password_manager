# Gateway module

This module will serve the entry point of the whole password manager service. Any interaction with the application needs to pass through this.

## Purpose
As mentioned before, any interaction with the application like user operations (login, registration or deletion) or vault queries must pass through this module. In this way, we centralize the entry point of the application and facilitate the security administration. It also helps mantain a order in the infrastructure of the application.

## Implementation guide
